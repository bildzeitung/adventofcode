# Advent of Code

These are my solutions and some notes on the same to the [Advent of Code][advent] event problems.

The event has been running since December, 2015. Since these are a sort of daily warm-up for me, it's all pretty rough. Years 2015, and 2017 are complete, and there's a thing or two I need to sort out in 2016.

I've included the problem statements as well, understanding that the text for those is (c) [Eric Wastl][eric].
