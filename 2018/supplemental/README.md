# Supplemental challenges

## from @rundavidrun
- Here's another challenge for all you #AdventOfCode puzzle solvers! Use the clues below to figure out my leaderboard code and join me! Enter the code at https://adventofcode.com/2018/leaderboard/private 

## first part

The first part of my #AdventOfCode leaderboard code is 51\_\_0. The \_\_ is represented by the 2-digit pair that is repeated most often in all the 5-digit primes. As a check, this pair is repeated 497 times.

- list of 5-digit primes: http://benvitale-funwithnum3ers.blogspot.com/2011/02/5-digit-prime-numbers.html

- answer: 51230

## second part

After a dash, the second part of my #AdventOfCode leaderboard code is af1\_\_ where \_\_ is a special sum. For each digit of pi up to the 3435th zero, if the digit is a 4, add 2, if it's a 3, add 17.

- retrieve 1 million digits of PI (should be enough???) from http://www.eveandersson.com/pi/digits/1000000

- answer: af165314

## final

51230-af165314
